This is analysis of a data set of NCAA Men's March Madness, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishaanamin/march-madness-data.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
team_results <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-03-26/team-results.csv')

ggplot(team_results, aes(y = R64, x = PAKE)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = CHAMP), size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_gradient(low="lightblue", high="black") +
  labs(
    y = "tournaments attended",
    x = "performance against komputer expectation",
    title = "Tournaments Attended Vs. Performance Against Komputer Expectation"
)
```
Analyzing this plot, it was interesting to see that schools with less than 4 attendances seemed to generally perform better against komputer expectation than those with between 4 and 8 attendances. It is also interesting to note that there are no champions from schools with less than 9 attendances. As expected, championship programs tended to have high performance against komputer expectation scores, with the top 2 scores both coming from multi time champs.
