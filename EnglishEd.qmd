This is analysis of a data set of education in English towns, which is from the 2021 cencus by The UK Office for National Statistics.
The data can be found at https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/datasets/educationalattainmentofyoungpeopleinenglishtownsdata/200708201819/youngpeoplesattainmentintownsreferencetable1.xlsx.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
english_education <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-01-23/english_education.csv')

ggplot(english_education, aes(y = population_2011 / 1000, x = education_score)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = university_flag),  alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    y = "town population (1000s)",
    x = "education score",
    title = "Town Population in English Towns Vs. Education Score"
)
```

Analyzing this plot, the first think I noticed is that the towns with universities tend to be larger than those without, with all the largest towns having universities. It also seemed that having a university did not significantly alter the expected education scores. More generally, I noticed that larger towns tended to skew towards lower education scores.
